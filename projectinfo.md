**Team Number:** 12

**Team Name:** sisters-of-the-road-connects

**Project Description:**
Our Project is based on the challenges presented by Sisters of the Road. We wanted to build a system that would help people find access to basic resources and facilities. Our app provides an easy to view map that displays different markers for bathrooms, showers, shelters, campsites, and facilities to charge devices. Users are able to add new resources to the map, or alert about a sweep that is happening.

**Additional Features:**
Adding a laundry and wifi resource type
Adding reviews/comments to resources
Submitting requests for help
Additional sweep tracking data
Ability to add photos of facilities

**Target Audience:**
This app is for all people who are homeless or living in poverty, and for all the people in the community who are willing and able to provide resources to them.
